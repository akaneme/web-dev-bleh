# Web Dev (yep)

hi! this is where i stash my basic web dev projects as i mess around ;-;  
they’re mostly minimalist and kept simple but with *my* vibe.  

might deploy some soon so you can peek at ‘em! ^^  
hope you like ‘em, and have a lovely day! off to work now, heh.

i'll learn how to center a div and then make a comeback, stay tuned.
